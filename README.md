# PROJECT ABSTRACT 

This project is Focusing on the detection of potholes, a major hazard for drivers, the study explores the potential of deep learning models for efficient detection and prevention. Three advanced deep learning models are employed specifically for pothole detection, with a focus on their implementation on edge devices for practical deployment. Proposing a cost-effective system, the project seeks to enable real-time monitoring of road pavement conditions. Data acquisitioninvolves timeâ€“frequency domain processing of signals from Micro-Electromechanical System sensors mounted on vehicles. These sensors provide crucial insights into the state of road surfaces, facilitating the identification of potholes and other distress factors. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evidenced by high classification rates, indicating its proficiency in recognizingvarious types of road surface distress and accurately detecting the presence of potholes. By leveraging deep learning techniques and edge computing, the project not only offers a robust solution for pothole detection but also demonstrates thefeasibility of implementing such systems in practical, real-world scenarios. This research contributes to enhancing road safety and infrastructure maintenance, benefiting both developing and developed nations alike in ensuring smoother and safer daily commutes.
